## &#9741; &nbsp; Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the historical series relating to the measurements of the electricity consumption of a city in Morocco in order to predict its trend. The following work was carried out using linear models, such as ARIMA and UCM, and non-linear models, including the KNN classification/regression algorithm and LSTM recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, two languages were used for the creation and analysis of these models, in particular the R language for the development of ARIMA, UCM and KNN and the Python language, in particular in the Google Colab environment, for LSTM. The results obtained from the execution of these models were then compared using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These values were used both to compare the behavior between the different families, but also to evaluate the goodness of the parameters chosen within the same family of models.
